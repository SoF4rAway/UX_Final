                                <p>Sebagai salah satu program kerja Program Studi  Sistem Informasi di tahun 2015, maka diinisiasi lah pendirian jurnal ilmiah di bidang sistem informasi.  Ketua program studi Ir. Darwison, MT, menugaskan Fajril Akbar dan tim untuk mendirikan  dan mengelola jurnal elektronik TEKNOSI yang merupakan singkatan dari Teknologi dan Sistem Informasi. ISSN cetak dan ISSN elektronik didaftarkan pada bulan April dan Oktober 2015. Edisi pertama diterbitkan di bulan Oktober dengan jumlah 6 artikel. Januari 2016, TEKNOSI telah diindeks oleh DOAJ, Google Scholar dan portal Garuda. Tahun 2016, TEKNOSI mulai menerbitkan 3 periode penerbitan yaitu April, Agustus dan Desember.</p>

                <h4>Hand Gesture to Control Virtual Keyboard using Neural Network</h4>
                <h6>Arrya Anandika, Muhammad Ilhamdi Rusydi, Pepi Putri Utami, Rizka Hadelina, Minoru Sasaki</h6>
                <h5>Abstract</h5>
                <p>Disability is one of a person's physical and mental conditions that can inhibit normal daily activities. One of the disabilities that can be found in disability is speech without fingers. Persons with disabilities have obstacles in communicating with people around both verbally and in writing. Communication tools to help people with disabilities without finger fingers continue to be developed, one of them is by creating a virtual keyboard using a Leap Motion sensor. The hand gestures are captured using the Leap Motion sensor so that the direction of the hand gesture in the form of pitch, yaw, and roll is obtained. The direction values are grouped into normal, right, left, up, down, and rotating gestures to control the virtual keyboard. The amount of data used for gesture recognition in this study was 5400 data consisting of 3780 training data and 1620 test data. The results of data testing conducted using the Artificial Neural Network method obtained an accuracy value of 98.82%. This study also performed a virtual keyboard performance test directly by typing 20 types of characters conducted by 15 respondents three times. The average time needed by respondents in typing is 5.45 seconds per character.</p>
